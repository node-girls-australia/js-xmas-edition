Level 2 - Local storage
=======================

Let's do overview for our actions on level 2.
After the user fills in the form and it pass all validation:
1. Once the user enters the values, in case of success validation
	- Add the values (name and the gift as an object along with a
	  unique id) to local storage.

2. When you are going to Wish List Page
	- Retrieve the wishes from local storage
	- Write the wishes to the DOM as a list of wishes

3. When you are going to the Santa's gift page
	- Here too we would read from local storage
	- Random number generator and display the image


1. Local Storage
=================

  We are getting information from the user and validating that
  information but when we refresh the page, that information is
  lost and the user has to type in all the information again.
  Wouldn't it be nice if we could save the information that the
  user types somewhere and we could use that information to display
  something..

  Here, the *Local storage* comes to the rescue ( We can replace the
  local storage with an actual database when we will work with more
  advanced data. What the database does is that it provides a location
  to store the data and when needed we can access the data.. Think of
  a cookie jar which is the database and the cookie as the data ;) )

  So, what is a local storage ?

  	It is a function which allows the web pages to store information
  locally on to the client's web browser using a key and value mechanism.
  Once we add the data to local storage,it will be available for ever
  unless we delete it.

  You can view the information stored in the Local Storage by

    * opening the console window
    * selecting the Application tab
    * within the Storage Menu, click on the down arrow near
      LocalStorage option
    * select the file:// to view the local storage details saved

  (go on, give it a try, chances are that you would not have any data
  yet..)

  There are 2 storage options available

	  1. `window.localStorage` - stores data with no expiration data
	  2. `window.sessionStorage` - stores data for one session (data is
	  lost when the browser tab is closed)

  we will make use of the `.localStorage` object (In case you don't know
  what is an object read below section on Objects first)

  With a local storage, we can either add contents to it, retrieve
  information from it or clear the local storage contents entirely which
  is explained in detail below

  ##### adding contents to local storage
    `localStorage.setItem(‘key’, value);`

  e.g: `var todos = $('#todos').html();`
    `localStorage.setItem('todos', todos);`

  ##### Retrieve information from Local Storage via the key
    `if(localStorage.getItem(‘key’))`

  e.g:
  ```
  if(localStorage.getItem('todos')) {
    $('#todos').html(localStorage.getItem('todos'));
  }
  ```

  ##### Clear all the local storage contents
    `window.localStorage.clear();`


  Local storage can only save strings, so storing objects requires that
  they be turned into strings (also known as serializing objects i.e
  converting an object to a string format) using JSON.stringify - you
  can’t ask local storage to store an object directly because it’ll store
  “[object Object]”, which isn’t right at all!
  That also means the object must be run through `JSON.parse` ( also known
  as deserializing i.e converting a string to an object) on the way out of
  local storage e.g:
  ```
  localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify({
    username: 'htmldog',
    api_key: 'abc123xyz789'
  }));

  var user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));
  ```

2. Save data to local storage
=============================

  Now lets use these information in to our code...

  We have validated the user, so now after  validation lets save the
  information in the local storage.
  Lets do the following
  TODO: 1.create a function with the name `saveDatatoLocalStorage`.

	TODO: 2. For now, we would only want to save the name and the gift
	description to local storage. So lets create 2 variables (`name` and
	`description`) that collects these information from the DOM

	TODO: 3. We would want a unique key to denote the data storage for
	each `name` and `description`. so lets create our own localstorage index:

	TODO: 4. declare a  global variable( in the beginning of the page)
	called `localStorageIndex` with value as `localStorage.length`

	TODO: 5. Note: the `localStorage.length` needs to be Zero first when
	we begin this tutorial, for that we need to empty the already existing
	local storage contents if any. This can be done by typing
	`window.localStorage.clear();` in the console.

	TODO: 6. inside, the function create another variable called `key` with
	the value as `'user'+ localStorageIndex`

	TODO: 7. Save the data as an object in the local storage by using the
	`setItem()`:
	```
	localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(
		{
			username: name,
			giftDescription: description
		}
	));
	```
	where key is the `key` and value is the serialized object with properties
	`username` and `giftDescription`

	TODO: 8. increment the `localStorageIndex`(this will ensure that we have
	unique keys)

	TODO: 9. Give it a try - refresh your `index.html` and then add the
	information - see if the entities have been added to the local storage.

  Yay !! we have added our contents to local storage now !!


3. Get data from local storage
==============================

   Now we would want to display the list of wishes stored in the local
   storage in our wish-list page.

   TODO: 1. Lets create another function called `displayWishes()`

	 TODO: 2. we would display our wishes as a list item, so get that element
	 from DOM in the variable `ul`

	 TODO: 3. we need to create a loop that would fetch all the items from
	 the local storage, so the index of the loop needs to be until the
	 `localstorage.length`.
	 The loop must do few things:
		-  create an element `li`.
		-  get the data from localstorage for that `userKey` and append it to `li`.
		e.g: `li.appendChild(document.createTextNode(data.giftDescription));`
		-  this `li` element must be appended to the `ul` element
		e.g: `ul.appendChild(li);`
	  The `appendChild()` adds the element `li` to `ul`. Here `ul` is the
	  parent and `li` is the child.

   We have a function, that would display the list of wishes, but when do we
   call this function ?
   As soon as the `wish-list.html` loads, we need all the elements to be
   displayed. So we call the function `displayWishes()` when the DOM is loading
   i.e on the `onload` event.

   TODO: add the `onload="displayWishes()"` in the body tag of the `wish-list.html`
   page

   To check if all works good, refresh the `wish-list.html` page and see if
   it displays the items.

### Notes:
#### Advantages of using local storage
 - more secure
 - large amount of data can be stored locally and it would not affect the
   website performance and has the storage limit of at least 5MB
 - information is never transferred to the server
 - data can be stored for ever, it does not have an expiry date
 - data is not lost when the browser is closed and is available at any time
   unless we delete it manually

Local storage is per origin (per domain and protocol). All pages, from one
origin, can store and access the same data.


#### Objects

Objects can be compared to real world objects (like a car, a spoon, house,
etc.. ) which have properties and a particular type. In Javascript (and
other programming languages), an object is one of the complex data types,
which have a list of keys and values
eg:
```
var car = {
	Model : 'Honda City',
	color: 'Red',
	owner: 'X1',
	yearOfManufacture: 2017
};
```
In the above example each item in the list is a property(e.g: Model, color,
owner, year) of the object 'car'.
The object can also have *functions* called as *methods*.

The property-name/ Key can be a string or a number.
eg:
```
var age = {
	10: 'kids'
	30: 'smart and wise'
	100: 'very very experienced'
};
```
We use objects mostly to store data and for creating custom methods and
functions.

There are 2 ways we can create objects
1. Object Literals
2. Object Constructors

###### Via Object Literals
We just declare an object name and within {} define all the properties
with its values:
```
 var myNewEmptyObject = {}

 var book = {
	name: 'Harry Potter Book1'
	author: 'J.K. Rowling'
	blurp: 'something magical... '
 };

sayHello: function() {
	console.log('Hello There');
};
```

###### Via Object Constructors
Constructors are functions that are used for initialising new objects using
the `new()` keyword.
Set the properties via the `object.propertyname` notation:
```
var book  = new Object();
book.name = 'Harry Potter Book1'
book.author = 'J.K.Rowling'
```

##### Accessing properties of an object:
- dot notation
- bracket notation
```
var book = {
	name: 'Harry Potter Book1'
	author: 'J.K. Rowling'
	blurp: 'something magical... '
 };
```
*Dot notation* is the most common way we access the objects.  Most of the
examples above use the dot notation
It follows the object-name.key-name syntax
```
console.log(book.name);
console.log(book.author);
```
*Bracket notation* follows the object-name[key-name] format
eg:
```
console.log(book['name']);
console.log(book['author']);
console.log(age[10]);
```
note: the property which is a number must use the bracket notation only


You can delete the properties of an object using the  `delete` keyword
e.g :
`delete book.blurp` - deletes the blurp property of book object
