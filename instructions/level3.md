Level 3. Randomize function
===========================

Level 1 gets the information from the user,
level 2 displays part of that information to the user as a list.
Now lets get to the fun part of level 3.

The aim here is based on the user Inputs
	* Determine if the user was Very Good, Good or Naughty
	* Identify the gift the person asked for
	* Send the gift to the user (as an Image, not the real one !!! )

*Oh and now we are not acting as Santa's but as **cheeky little imps..**
so we are getting a bit naughty and mixing up the gifts that Santa
gives out. How do we mix things up.. By messing with the inputs that
we display in the `result.html`*

First lets create a random number generator function, that would take
the limit as an the input and then returns any random number from 0 to
that limit .

To do that, we would use JavaSript's built-in Object called *'Math'* which
as the name indicates, has properties and methods for Mathematical
functions and constants (e.g : Math.PI, Math.SQRT, etc). There are many
built in objects like that available in javascript such as Date, String,
Array, etc.

refer:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math
for more Math functions/ constants available

For the Random number generator function, lets use the following formulae
	Math.floor(Math.random() * limit) + 1;

Now lets get a random behaviour for the user - the three types of
behaviour are Very Good, Good and Naughty.
Create an object with these 3 behaviour types. (Remember Objects from
Level 2 !!!). for easy access, let the key of the objects be as numbers
e.g
```
var BehaviourList = {
	1: 'Very Good'
	2: 'Good'
	3: 'Naughty'
}
```
The next step is to create a function called `getRandomBehaviour()`.
The function should do the following:
	1. Get the random number from 0..3 [since we have 3 behaviour types,
	we set the limit to 3 ] by calling the `randomNumberGenerator()` function
	2. Using this random number as the key, get the behaviour from Behaviour
	list e.g: `randomBehaviour =  BehaviourList[randomNumber]`
	3. Display the Behaviour in the DOM, using the query selector for
	`.attitude` class

After creating the function, lets check if this works correctly by calling
the function in the `<body>` section of `result.html` page using the `onLoad`
event

Yuppiee, the imp is able to modify the behaviour of the user every time
the user refreshes the `result.html` page!!!

Now that we have done the behaviour bit and its kind of fun.. lets mess
with the gifts..

We would use the list of gifts description in the local storage (Hope
you haven't forgotten the local storage in level 2 !!) and use the similar
steps as above and get random gift.

Lets name the function as `getRandomGift()` and this would do the following
	1. Get the random number using `getRandomNumber()` function. Note here the
	limit should be the no of gifts in local Storage, so we can use the
	`localStorageIndex` count.
	**P.S:** Since we increment the `localStorgaeIndex` after adding new gift,
	the index value would be 1 count extra, so we need to use the limit as
	`localStorageIndex-1`
	2. This random no can be used to get the gift description at that location
	(use the key as `user+'randonNo'`) in local storage
	3. Display the `gift.description` name in DOM by using the query selector
	`.santa-gift-text`

Lets check if this works correctly by calling the function in the `<body>`
section of `result.html` page using the `onLoad` event

Just displaying the behaviour and gift description is boring, so lets play
with some images..
We have some images of gifts in the img/gifts folder. we would randomly display
one of those images and display them in the `result.html` page

Lets create an object called `ImageUrlList` which would contain the key as
numbers and the value as the imageurl with names
e.g :
```
var imageUrlList = {
	1: 'img/gifts/goldGift.jpg',
	2: 'img/gifts/groupGift.jpeg',
	3: 'img/gifts/redGift.jpg'
}
```
Here again we are using numbers as key so that it would be easy to use the
`randomNummber` Generator to get the images..

After that, lets create a function called `getGiftImage()`. This would

	1. get the random number( depending on the number of images in the folder,
for now its 3)
if you add more images, you can increment the limit accordingly.
	2. get the image url using the random no from the imageUrlList i.e
`imageUrlList[randomNumber]`
	3. setting the url as the source of the DOM element `.santa-gift` in
`result.html`
```
function getGiftImage() {
	var element = document.querySelector('.santa-gift');
	var randomNo = getRandomNumber(3);
	var giftImageUrl = imageUrlList[randomNo];
	element.src = giftImageUrl;
}
```
You can check the function, by calling it in the `onLoad` event in the `<body>`
section.

Now the final Bit, We have 3 functions, but we call each one individually in
the DOM using the `onLoad()` event.
It would be really nice if we could call all the three functions when the page
loads..
How we can achieve it ??
One such way is to call all the three functions inside another function say
`fillContent()` and then just call the `fillContent()` method in the `Onload()`
event.
Go on.. give it a try..
If all the DOM elements are loaded simultaneously.. Then everything works fine..

 Celebrate your achievement !!
 You could try the extra steps if you want to try more stuffs
